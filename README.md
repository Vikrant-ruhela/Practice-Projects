# Milestone Repository

Welcome to the Milestone Repository! This repository contains three projects that I have developed:

## Project 1: Blog Project

The Blog Project is a simple web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to create and save their blogs locally. The HTML and CSS are used to provide a visually appealing and user-friendly interface, while JavaScript handles the blog creation and local storage functionality.

### Technologies Used:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Project 2: Movie Searching App

The Movie Searching App is another web application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This app enables users to search for movies and retrieve relevant information from the OMDB API. The retrieved movie data is displayed in the form of cards.

### Technologies Used:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- OMDB API

## Project 3: Todo List

The Todo List is a more advanced project built using React.js. In this app, I used the useState hook to manage the state of the application. The entire project is designed and developed using React.js, allowing for a more dynamic and interactive user experience.

### Technologies Used:

- React.js

## How to Use Each Project

Each project is contained within its own directory inside this repository. To explore and run each project, follow the instructions provided in their respective README files.

# mileStoneRepo

Inside this mileStoneRepo I have created three projects which are as follows:

1. Project1 (Blog project)- I used HTML, CSS, and JS in this project. HTML and CSS are used here to give structure and design. With the help of javascript, I created blogs and then saved them to localstorage.

2. Project2 (Movie searching app)- I used HTML, CSS, and JS in this project. HTML and CSS are used here to give structure and design. With the help of javascript, I used to do an API request to OMDB API to get movie data and display it in the form of cards.

3. Project3 (Todo list)- I used React Js to create this app. In this app, we manage the hook using the useState hook and design the entire project with the help of react js.
